# Test Fixtures

⚠️ **DO NOT COMMIT REAL SPED FILES**

Place your test SPED files here for local testing only.
These files are ignored by git (.gitignore).

## Required Files for Tests

Place these files in this directory to run integration tests:
- `efd-contribuicoes.txt` - EFD Contribuições test file
- `efd-fiscal.txt` - EFD Fiscal test file  
- `ecd.txt` - ECD test file

## Creating Test Files

Use your own SPED files or synthetic/anonymized data.
Never commit files with real company data to public repositories.
